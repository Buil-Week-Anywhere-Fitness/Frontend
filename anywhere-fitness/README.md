* Make sure your new branch is up-to-date with `frontend-dev`
* Push commits to your own branch and make your PRs to the `frontend-dev` branch
* Check the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/tfNlrzvM/anywhere-fitness) before beginning work to make sure no one else is currently working on that feature or component
